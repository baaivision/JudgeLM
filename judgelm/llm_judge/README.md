# JudgeLM for different benchmarks

JudgeLM presents a strong 0-shot ability to many open-ended benchmarks.
Now we support the following benchmarks:
- JudgeLM val set
- MM-Vet

For simplicity of use, you can download our uploaded [dataset collection](https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/JudgeLM-data-collection-v1.0),
and put the contents in the `JudgeLM/judgelm/data` folder.

## Judge the Quality of LLMs-Generated Answer Pairs

We provide scripts to judge the quality of LLMs-generated answer pairs. We first put the LLM-generated results json file into benchmark folder, and then preprocess for judge samples. Finally, we make judgements by JudgeLM. Furthermore, we provide a single script to run the whole process at last.

### Judge on JudgeLM Benchmark Step by Step

#### Step 1. Put LLM-generated results json file in benchmark folder `./judgelm/data/JudgeLM/answers`, following the format of `./judgelm/data/JudgeLM/answers/alpaca_judgelm_val.jsonl`

e.g.,

```json
{
  "question_id": 0, 
  "question_body": "My internet service is very expensive...", 
  "decoding_method": "top_p_sampling", 
  "model": "alpaca-native", 
  "text": "There are a few ways to cut down the cost...", 
  "scores": {"logprobs": -7.0179795026779175,...}
}
```

Among the keys, `question_id`, `question_body`, `text` are required, and `decoding_method`, `model`, `scores` are optional (can be some placeholder).

#### Step 2. Preprocess for judge samples


```bash
python ./judgelm/data/JudgeLM/judgelm_preprocess.py \
--ans1_file_path [ANS1_FILE_PATH] \
--ans2_file_path [ANS2_FILE_PATH]
```

Arguments:
  - `[ANS1_FILE_PATH]` is the path to the answer file 1.
  - `[ANS2_FILE_PATH]` is the path to the answer file 2.

e.g.,

```bash
python ./judgelm/data/JudgeLM/judgelm_preprocess.py \
--ans1_file_path /share/project/lianghuizhu/JudgeLM-Project/JudgeLM/judgelm/data/JudgeLM/answers/vicuna_judgelm_val.jsonl \
--ans2_file_path /share/project/lianghuizhu/JudgeLM-Project/JudgeLM/judgelm/data/JudgeLM/answers/llama_judgelm_val.jsonl
```

After this, we can get judge samples like `./judgelm/data/JudgeLM/judgelm-val-5k-judge-samples.jsonl`

#### Step 3. Make judgements by JudgeLM

```bash
python ./judgelm/llm_judge/gen_model_judgement.py \ 
--model-path [MODEL_PATH] \
--model-id [MODEL_ID] \
--question-file ./judgelm/data/JudgeLM/judgelm-val-5k-judge-samples.jsonl \
--answer-file [ANSWER_FILE_PATH] \
--num-gpus-per-model [NUM_GPUS_PER_MODEL] \
--num-gpus-total [NUM_GPUS_TOTAL] \
--temperature [TEMPERATURE] \
--reference-file [REFERENCE_FILE_PATH] \
--if-fast-eval [IF_FAST_EVAL] 
```

Arguments:
  - `[MODEL_PATH]` is the path to the judge weights, which can be a local folder.
  - `[MODEL_ID]` is a name you give to the judge model.
  - `[ANSWER_FILE_PATH]` is the path to the output judgements.

  - `[NUM_GPUS_PER_MODEL]` is the gpu nums that used to run the judge model.
  - `[NUM_GPUS_TOTAL]` is the total gpu nums that used to run the judge model.
  - `[TEMPERATURE]` is the temperature used to sample the judge model.
  - `[REFERENCE_FILE_PATH]`, is the path to the reference answers. It can be "None" if you dont need the JudgeLM make judgements with reference answers.
  - `[IF_FAST_EVAL]`, int, 0 or 1, represents if use the fast eval (without reasons generation).

e.g.,

```bash
python ./judgelm/llm_judge/gen_model_judgement.py \
--model-path "/home/zhulianghui/ProjectC_ChatGPT/alpaca-quan/output/vicuna-7b-v1.3-data(judgelm-train-0628-gpt4-100k-w-reference-all-w-reference-drop)-bs128-ep3-lr2e-5-wd0.-wr0.03-cosine-mmlength2048-lazy-preprocess-swap-aug-ref_drop_ratio0.5" \

## Grade the Single Answer
Given a question and the corresponding reference answer, JudgeLM can grade the LLM-generated single answer. 
We first put the LLM-generated results json file into benchmark folder, and then preprocess the reference answer file and the LLM-generated answer file. 
Finally, we grade single answer by JudgeLM. Furthermore, we provide a single script to run the whole process at last.

### ⭐️ Grade the Multi Answer on JudgeLM Benchmark with a Single Script

```bash
bash ./scripts/grade_multi_answer_on_judgelm_benchmark.sh 
```

## Grade Multiple Answers
Given a question and the corresponding reference answer, JudgeLM can grade multiple LLM-generated answers. 
We first put the LLM-generated results json file into benchmark folder, and then preprocess the LLM-generated answer files. 
Finally, we grade multiple answers by JudgeLM. Furthermore, we provide a single script to run the whole process at last.

### Grade Multiple Answers on JudgeLM Benchmark Step by Step

  "model": "alpaca-native", 
  "text": "There are a few ways to cut down the cost...", 
  "scores": {"logprobs": -7.0179795026779175,...}
}
```

Among the keys, `question_id`, `question_body`, `text` are required, and `decoding_method`, `model`, `scores` are optional (can be some placeholder).

#### Step 2. Preprocess for judge samples

### ⭐️ Evaluate Judge on JudgeLM Benchmark with a Single Script

```bash
bash ./scripts/eval_judge_on_judgelm_benchmark.sh 
```

## MM-Vet Benchmark

The proposed JudgeLM is easy to apply in modern multimodal benchmarks, e.g., MM-Vet. First, we put the multimodal results json file in benchmark folder, and then preprocess for judge samples. Finally, we make judgements by JudgeLM. Furthermore, we provide a single script to run the whole process at last.

### Evaluate on MM-Vet Benchmark through JudgeLM Step by Step

#### Step 1. Put Multimodal-results json file in benchmark folder

```bash
mv /path/to/reuslts.json ./judgelm/data/MM-Vet/mm-vet-xxx-prediction.json
```

e.g.,

```bash
mv /Projects/Emu/predictions/results-23-10-10.json ./judgelm/data/MM-Vet/mm-vet-emu-prediction.json
```

#### Step 2. Preprocess for judge samples

```bash
python ./judgelm/data/MM-Vet/mmvet_preprocess.py --gt_file_path ./judgelm/data/MM-Vet/mm-vet-gt.json --pred_file_path ./judgelm/data/MM-Vet/mm-vet-xxx-prediction.json
```

e.g.,
```bash
python ./judgelm/data/MM-Vet/mmvet_preprocess.py --gt_file_path ./judgelm/data/MM-Vet/mm-vet-gt.json --pred_file_path ./judgelm/data/MM-Vet/mm-vet-emu-prediction.json
```

After this, we can get judge samples like `./judgelm/data/MM-Vet/mm-vet-judge-samples.jsonl`

#### Step 3. Make judgements by JudgeLM

```bash
python ./judgelm/llm_judge/gen_model_judgement_mmvet.py --model-path [MODEL_PATH] --model-id [MODEL_ID] --question-file ./judgelm/data/MM-Vet/mmvet_predictions.jsonl --answer-file [ANSWER_FILE_PATH] --num-gpus-per-model [NUM_GPUS_PER_MODEL] --num-gpus-total [NUM_GPUS_TOTAL] --temperature [TEMPERATURE] --if-fast-eval [IF_FAST_EVAL] 
```

Arguments:
  - `[MODEL_PATH]` is the path to the judge weights, which can be a local folder.
  - `[MODEL_ID]` is a name you give to the judge model.
  - `[ANSWER_FILE_PATH]` is the path to the output judgements.
  - `[IF_FAST_EVAL]`, int, 0 or 1, represents if use the fast eval (without reasons generation).

e.g.,
```bash
python ./judgelm/llm_judge/gen_model_judgement_mmvet.py --model-path ./checkpoints_output/judgelm-33b-v1.0-full-model --model-id 33b-full-model --question-file ./judgelm/data/MM-Vet/mmvet_predictions.jsonl --answer-file ./judgements_output/MM-Vet/33b-full-model --num-gpus-per-model 2 --num-gpus-total 4 --temperature 0.2 --if-fast-eval 1 
```

### ⭐️Evaluate on MM-Vet Benchmark with a Single Script

```bash
bash ./scripts/judge_on_mmvet_benchmark.sh 
```
